Welcome to the front end for my Z-Prefix CRUD Project

Before using, make sure you have all dependencies installed (npm, react, react-router-dom) and have verified that your API is up and running.

You can launch the app with npm run dev

Notes for using the app:
1. You will only be able to update or delete items that belong to the signed in user.
